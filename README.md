NICURx is a medical-grade calculator used to automatically determine medication doses for neonates. Intended for use by 
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) practitioners, NICURx makes checking all calculations for NICU patients simpler. With its abilities to create
a medical record for each patient and select which medications patients are on, automatic calculations are readily available.
